\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In the domain of RGB-D camera software, the space of applications in which the
camera is mounted to the user remains relatively unexplored. Guide Dog attempts
to explore this space as a prototype guidance tool for users who are either
visually impaired or unable to see for other reasons. The Guide Dog system
described here makes many simplifying assumptions about its environment and
use cases, but research in related domains is very encouraging. Advances in
object detection and labeling could be incorporated to make Guide Dog's
destination guidance far more robust, and recent results in 3D mapping and
reconstruction could be incorporated to remove Guide Dog from the confines
of its local field of view. If incorporated into the system, these items
would make Guide Dog a useful tool for practical situations, and would bring
Guide Dog much closer to the initial vision of the authors. 

Guide Dog's implementation is publically available to use and build
upon~\cite{guidedog-website}.
